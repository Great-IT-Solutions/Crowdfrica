        <div class="Advisors-brief">
            <p>When a campaign is fully funded, we transfer funds to the healthcare partner once treatment is confirmed. For health insurance, we do the registration for the person. When a classroom request is fully funded, we buy all requested materials and send them directly to the school. For entrepreneurs, we transfer the funds to them directly once their total funding request has been achieved.
