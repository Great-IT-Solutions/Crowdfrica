  <p>Hi
    <%= @donor_name%>,</p>
  <p>I want to personally say thank you for the awesome thing you have done today</p>

  <p>In few weeks you will get a thank you and photos from the community you helped. In the mean time, can I share my story with you?</p>

  <p>.. I was in my room and my mum came to ask me for GHS 20.00 ($5) to help take my brother to hospital because the family could not afford to. I told my mother I had no money. She left and a week later, came up to me and told me that my brother had
    died. I was in shock and distraught. I couldn't help but think this could happen to someone else in our family or a friend close to me, and so I decided to do something about it. After visiting neighbouring villages speaking to nurses and community
    members about their healthcare challanges and hopes, Crowdfrica was born.</p>

  <p>
