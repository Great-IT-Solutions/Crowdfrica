Hi <%= @donor_name%>,

I want to personally say thank you for the awesome thing you have done today

In few weeks you will get thank-you and photos from the community you helped.
In the mean time, can I share my story with you?

.. I was in my room and my mum came to ask me for GHS 20.00 ($5) to help
 take my brother to hospital because the family could not afford to. I told
 my mother I had no money. She left and a week later, came up to me and told
 me that my brother had died. I was in shock and distraught. I couldn't help but
 think this could happen to someone else in our family or a friend close to me,
 and so I decided to do something about it. After visiting neighbouring villages
 speaking to nurses and community members about their health care challenges and
 hopes, Crowdfrica was born.

 Thanks for making your first donation on Crowdfrica.org, and for making a
 difference. Our mission is to promote prosperity in Africa by connecting
 people for equity in health care and quality in education. Welcome to the
 Crowdfrica community!
